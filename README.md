# ViktoriyaPetrova.github.io

This website was created as a final project to my Intro to Web Development class at Portland State University. It showcases everything that I learned throughout the term - including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JQuery. My main focus with this project was to create something that is a reflection of who I am as a person. Everything from the color theme to the icons and cliparts were carefully thought out and created by me as a way to show my creative side. This website is still a work in progress, the more I learn the more I will add to it. The next planned update is refactoring the navbar and footer implementation to make it cleaner and easier to maintain, as well as learning PHP in order to improve functionality for the "Contact" page.

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages with the following URL:

https://viktoriyapetrova.github.io/.

The code itself can be downloaded and run on VS Code using the Live Server extension.
