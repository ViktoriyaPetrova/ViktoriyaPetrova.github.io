          Hi, my name is Viktoriya Petrova and I'm a Computer Science major at
          Portland State University. For the past five years, I've had the
          pleasure of working in public health where I applied my skills and
          knowledge to helping people. At the beginning of the pandemic, I
          decided to make a career change and get a bachelor's degree for
          something that has always been a passion of mine. I've always been
          drawn to computers and technology so going through the Computer
          Science program at PSU has been a very pleasant experience. While
          going through school I've had the opportunity to work for the Computer
          Action Team at the Maseeh College of Engineering. There, I've gained
          experience in working with the college's ticketing system, providing
          maintenance and support to users, reading and writing documentation,
          writing scripts, working with remote/on-site Linux and Windows
          machines, and much much more. I'm very grateful for everything that
          they have taught me and I look forward to working with them for
          another year until I graduate.
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-6" id="bio2">
          After going through the core classes in my Junior year, I fell in love
          with Databases and Web Development. For that reason, I'm planning on
          steering my education towards Full Stack Development. That way I can
          apply my knowledge of databases to the back end and my knowledge of
          Web Dev to the front end. Now that I know what area of Computer
          Science I want to focus on, I've mapped out a couple of projects that
          I would like to complete this summer. The biggest one being a dental
          data center with a fully functional database and a web based user
          terminal system. This project is similar to something my group did in
          my Software Engineering class but with my own spin on it to incoporate
          all of the skills I would like to practice. Additionally, I would like
          to spend some time this summer getting familiar with commonly used
          softwares/languages such as Angular, Tableau, Azure, PHP, and React.
          I'm very excited to see where this journey takes me and how much I can
          grow as a programmer.
